# Photos27_Android

Photos 27 is a simple photo management application built natively with Android studio. It's a photo album application with simple CRUD functionality, geo-tagging(Not based on lat and long), and general tagging.

## VERY IMPORTANT

Do not delete any ALBUM named Download. This album is linked to the SD Card -> Download directory, deleting the album
will delete the directory as they are linked, at the moment we are unable to find a resolution. 


When an album is created a blank black sample image is placed into the album, for when an album has no pictures, it is automatically deleted.
Once you add a photo to the album, you can remove the black sample image.

## Getting Started

Clone the directory. From there open the images folder and put it on your desktop, drag all of those images into the emulator.
These images will live in the emulators sd card under Download 


## Running the tests

use the plus button to add albums, as well as add photos when inside of an album.
When in an album you can add photos from the camera itself,
or from SD Card ->Download (which are the dragged in images) 

Long pressing on a photo or album will open up the CRUD functionality, short pressing will open the album or picture.
